## Solving the problems on ProjectEuler.net

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) is a series of mathematical and computer programming problems. There are more than 440 problems and are continuously expanding.

I am trying to solve the problems to train my mathematics and programming skills. Right now I am coding in Python because of Python's rich libraries, high-level data types and dynamic typing. I can focus on the problem itself and produce very clean and readable codes.
